        <h2>A Computational View on the Asymmetry of Time</h2>
      <p>
        This entry introduces the idea that the arrow of time, its apparent irreversibility, is not solely a consequence of thermodynamic constraints or psychological phenomena, but a reflection of an underlying computational asymmetry inherent to the physical universe. I introduce a model of physics as an unbounded stateless computer that exists outside of space and time, one which can access information about all matter in the universe. This computer does not evolve; rather, it applies the transition rules of physics to the current state of the universe, producing the next. If the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics holds, this computer can access only one instance of the universe, meaning it is possible for information to be lost to this computer without being lost as a whole. While it has access to the entire present configuration of the universe, it enforces internal locality, relativistic causality, and quantum constraints. Within these constraints, I argue that in systems characterized by many-to-one state transitions, the directionality of time emerges from the computer's inability to reconstruct past states. Temporal asymmetry, under this framework, is a consequence of computational intractability: time flows forward because only forward evolution admits a well-posed computation.

        <p><strong>Physics as a Stateless Computer</strong></p>
        <p>
          Consider the unfolding of physics as a hypothetical computer with complete instantaneous access to the present state of the universe, denoted \(S_t\). This computer possesses full knowledge of all particles, fields, and governing dynamics \(f\), but lacks any persistent memory of prior configurations \(S_{t-1}\). It functions as a stateless computational engine, applying physical laws directly to the current state to produce the next:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ S_{t+1} = f(S_t) \]
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, this computer cannot reconstruct \(S_{t-1}\) from \(S_t\) unless \(f\) is bijective. In the general case, where \(f\) is non-injective (i.e., many-to-one), the mapping is irreversible:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ \exists S_{t-1}^{(1)} \neq S_{t-1}^{(2)} : f(S_{t-1}^{(1)}) = f(S_{t-1}^{(2)}) = S_t \]
        </p>
        <p>
          This renders the inverse computation ill-defined, as the computer has no mechanism to distinguish or automatically select the correct precursor among multiple plausible candidates to the current state.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Irreversibility Across Scales</strong></p>
        <p>
          Irreversible dynamics manifest at multiple physical scales:
          <ul>
            <li><em>Macroscopic systems</em>: Diverse causal histories may lead to identical macrostates. Human decision-making, for instance, reflects this degeneracy: the same belief or action may result from numerous experiential trajectories.</li>
            <li><em>Neural systems</em>: A neuron's spike is a discrete, lossy transformation of high-dimensional continuous input. Post-spike, the fine-grained synaptic configuration that triggered it becomes unrecoverable.</li>
            <li><em>Quantum systems</em>: While unitary evolution is time-reversible, measurement collapses the wavefunction, destroying phase coherence and precluding full recovery of the prior superposition.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In each case, the forward transition \(f\) acts as a lossy compression operator; its inverse lacks a unique solution without external memory or auxiliary constraints.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Compression of Futures into a Single Present</strong></p>
        <p>
        What distinguishes the past from the future under this model is not merely entropy, but the asymmetry of representational compression. While the past may consist of many possible prior states that converge to the current one (i.e., many-to-one), the future evolves deterministically (or probabilistically, but still computably) into a single next state. In effect, forward transitions squeeze the plurality of potential futures into a unique present, collapsing uncertainty into actuality. This directional compression ensures that:
        </p>

        <p>
        $$
        \exists \, S_{t-1}^{(1)} \neq S_{t-1}^{(2)} : f(S_{t-1}^{(1)}) = f(S_{t-1}^{(2)}) = S_t,
        \quad \text{but} \quad f(S_t) \rightarrow S_{t+1} \text{ is unique}
        $$
        </p>

        <p>
        The future is funneled into one consistent present, while the past branches remain computationally inaccessible without auxiliary constraints. This asymmetry, one-to-many in reverse but one-to-one (or deterministic/stochastic but computable) in forward time, explains why only forward simulation is feasible for the stateless, unbounded computer.
        </p>

        <p><strong>The Computational Arrow of Time</strong></p>
        <p>
          In a universe governed exclusively by reversible dynamics, temporal directionality would be arbitrary: both forward and backward evolution would be computationally equivalent. In such a system, the computer could compute:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ S_{t+1} = f(S_t) \quad \text{and} \quad S_{t-1} = f^{-1}(S_t) \]
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with the ubiquity of irreversible transitions, only the forward direction admits a well-defined, computable update. The backward direction is fundamentally ill-posed: it entails inference over an unbounded, often unenumerable, space of past configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, the arrow of time is not imposed externally by physical law, but internally selected by the computer according to computational feasibility.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion: Computability as Temporal Grounding</strong></p>
        <p>
          Temporal directionality, in this formulation, is a derived property of a system's informational structure and the computerâ€™s computational constraints. For an unbounded computer devoid of memory, one limited to present-state evaluation of the universe, the direction of time corresponds to the axis along which simulation remains well-posed. The universe does not inherently flow toward the future; it is simply the only direction that remains accessible to forward modeling. This principle can be formalized as:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ \text{Time direction} = \arg\min_{d \in \{\text{forward}, \text{backward}\}} \text{Complexity}(\text{Compute}(S_d)) \]
        </p>
        <p>
          This perspective suggests a unification of temporal asymmetry with complexity theory, where the apparent irreversibility of the world is not merely thermodynamic but computational in essence. It invites further inquiry into how informational constraints shape our most fundamental intuitions about time.
