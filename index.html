      <h1>Niel Jongwhan Ok</h1>
      <p class="tagline">systems+theory guy building Null Labs as cofounder/CTO after leaving Stanford.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <ul class="bullet tight">
        <li>grew up across Louisiana, Colorado, Texas, Ohio</li>
        <li>got my start in AI in 2018 building diagnostic &amp; generative models for medical imaging</li>
        <li>became fascinated at 15 by quantum entanglement and ER=EPR. wrote a simulator supporting mid-circuit statevector extraction (sponsored by Google Quantum, filled a gap in IBM/Google tools) and used it to develop quantum teleportation protocols for new Google hardware</li>
        <li>studied EE at Stanford</li>
        <li>curiosity about the gap between neural nets and the brain led me into theoretical neuroscience and neuromorphic computing research at the Stanford Brains in Silicon Lab, where I modeled dendrite-level dynamics with circuits and differential equations</li>
        <li>spent time between DeepMind and a DeepMind spinout (hire number 2) working on automating AI research and inference scaling/interpretability methods for robotics and text diffusion models</li>
        <li>co-founder/CTO of Null Labs, leveraging computable physics to train autonomous systems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Thoughts</h2>
      <ul class="bullet tight">
        <li>language can structure thought in useful ways but also restricts it</li>
        <li>scaling laws: learning is incremental under today's frameworks</li>
        <li>different frameworks = different slopes. but the right one may escape gradualism</li>
        <li>AI progress has plateaued on internet data. the next frontier will involve harnessing computable physics and interactions with environments more effectively</li>
        <li>physics, math, language, and computation all have generative asymmetry in that they are examples of small rule sets leading to rich behaviors. there may be a reason for this structure</li>
        <li>based on the performance of recent AI models, it seems consciousness may not be required to create digital beings that can perform tasks at the level of human intelligence. what exactly is the purpose of consciousness, then?</li>
      </ul>
