    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>Born in Louisiana, also lived in Colorado, Texas, Ohio</li>
      <li>Got exposed to AI when I got my first laptop, built CV diagnostics and generative models for medical imaging</li>
      <li>Took an interest to quantum computing at 16 after learning about entanglement and ER=EPR, wrote a simulator with better entangled state extraction than existing simulators from IBM and Google with sponsorship from Google Quantum</li>
      <li>Started Stanford as an EE undergrad</li>
      <li>Curiosity about the gap between neural nets and the brain led me to research in theoretical neuroscience and neuromorphic computing at Stanford Brains in Silicon, where I got to get down to the level of differential equations modeling dendrite-level dynamics</li>
      <li>Spent time between DeepMind and a DeepMind spinout (hire number 2) working on automating AI research and new inference scaling and interpretability methods for robotics/text diffusion models</li>
      <li>Co-founder/CTO of Null Labs</li>
      <li>Believe that computable physics and variation could be much better utilized in training autonomous systems than what is currently being done</li>
      <li>Randomly end up questioning things that seem fundamental</li>
    </ul>
