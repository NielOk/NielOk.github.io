    <h1>Niel Jongwhan Ok</h1>
    <div class="description">
      I'm a systems+theory guy, currently building Null Labs as cofounder and CTO after leaving Stanford. We believe human knowledge of physics is severely underutilized in training embodied intelligence and are working on fixing that. 
    </div>

    <div class="description">   
      Previously, I led infrastructure as the second hire at an applied AI lab out of DeepMind working on automating AI research. I also did DeepMind-sponsored work on frontier models, including inference scaling for Gemini Diffusion and diffusion policies for robotics.

    <div class="description">
      Outside of AI, I was a researcher in theoretical neuroscience and neuromorphic computing at the Stanford Brains in Silicon lab and have done quantum informatics+computing research sponsored by IBM and Google.
