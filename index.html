    <h1>Niel Jongwhan Ok</h1>
    <div class="description">
      I'm a systems+theory guy, currently building Null Labs as cofounder and CTO after leaving Stanford. We believe that human knowledge of physics is severely underutilized in training embodied models, and are working on fixing that. 
    </div>

    <div class="description">   
      Previously, I led infra as hire number 2 at an applied AI lab out of DeepMind working on automating AI research.
    </div>

    <div class="description">
      I've also done DeepMind-sponsored research on inference scaling and interpretability for text diffusion models leading up to the Gemini Diffusion launch, trajectory-search for stochastic diffusion models, and variance-aware inference scaling for robotics diffusion models. 
    </div>

    <div class="description">
      Outside of AI, I've been a researcher in theoretical neuroscience and neuromorphic computing at the Stanford Brains in Silicon lab and have done quantum informatics+computing research sponsored by IBM and Google. 
    </div>

    <div class="description">
      My writing page linked in the header is more of a brain dump than a formal blog where I leave notes on fundamental questions in physics and the nature of learning and intelligence.
