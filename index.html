      <h1>Niel Jongwhan Ok</h1>
      <p class="tagline">i'm currently building Null Labs as cofounder/CTO. i previously studied at Stanford.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <ul class="bullet tight">
        <li>grew up across Louisiana, Colorado, Texas, Ohio</li>
        <li>got my start in AI in 2018 building diagnostic &amp; generative models for medical imaging</li>
        <li>became fascinated with physics and simulation at 15 after discovering quantum entanglement and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_%3D_EPR" target="_blank">ER=EPR</a>. went on to write a quantum simulator and quantum teleportation protocols sponsored by <a href="https://quantumai.google" target="_blank">Google Quantum</a>, as well as simulations of evolution</li>
        <li>studied EE at Stanford</li>
        <li>curiosity about the gap between neural nets and the brain led me into theoretical neuroscience research at <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/" target="_blank">Stanford Brains in Silicon</a>, where I wrote code converting 3d neural morphologies to computational experiments for spatiotemporal dynamics</li>
        <li>spent time between <a href="https://deepmind.google" target="_blank">DeepMind</a> and a DeepMind spinout (hire number 2) working on automating AI research and inference scaling/interpretability methods for robotics and text diffusion models</li>
        <li>co-founder/CTO of <a href="https://n0labs.com" target="_blank">Null Labs</a>, using computable physics to train autonomous systems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Thoughts</h2>
      <ul class="bullet tight">
        <li>language provides structure for thought. all structures restrict</li>
        <li>learning is overrated atm. frameworks and abstractions are underrated</li>
        <li>we should measure scaling laws for the tasks we actually care about</li>
        <li>AI progress has plateaued on internet data. the next frontier will involve harnessing computable physics and interactions with environments more effectively</li>
        <li>physics, math, language, and computation all have generative asymmetry (small sets of rules with rich behaviors). there may be reasons for this structure</li>
        <li>it now seems consciousness may not be required to create digital beings that can perform tasks at human level. what exactly is the purpose of consciousness, then?</li>
      </ul>
